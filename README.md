# langGraph MOOC Coursera 

This repository contains the code for the different chapters of the langGraph [MOOC course by Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-agents-in-langgraph/ungradedLti/aTuRL/ai-agents-in-langgraph)

The code has been implemented with the library for opeai but using gemini and the api key for it. To run it, let's create the __.env__ file with the following content and paste your api key replacing the "API KEY" text:

    GOOGLE_API_KEY="API KEY"

At the same time, open AI can be used as well using:

    OPENAI_API_KEY="API KEY"
